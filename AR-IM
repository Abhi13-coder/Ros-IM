The Arc Reactor subsystem, 
which serves as the central power and data nerve center of the ROS-IM suit. 
The Arc Reactor integrates high-performance CPU (64-bit, 16-core), modular RAM clusters (including Mega-RAM and RAM managers), a distributed battery and energy management system, and wireless communication nodes (WiFi, Bluetooth).
System ComponentsCPU & RAM Cluster:
64-bit/16-core processor manages overall computation and real-time decision-making.
Central RAM banks and managers communicate with distributed microcontroller nodes [Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi].
Mega-RAM (32GB) for advanced AI workloads and rapid sensor fusion.
Battery Architecture:
Multiple battery units ("battery ultra") supply power redundantly across all subsystems.Batteries are monitored and balanced for safety and longevity.
Wireless Communication:
Integrated chip transmitters for WiFi and Bluetooth enable remote control, diagnostics, and data relay.
Microcontroller Integration:
Node connections to ESP32, Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi (AI, RAM) via RAM managers and ROS2 processors.
Each microcontroller can be given dedicated storage and battery support.
RAM managers ensure efficient memory allocation, system synchronization, and modular expansion.
Storage & Data Management:
Onboard storage modules for high-speed data logging and retrieval.
ROS IntegrationROS2 Nodes:
Each RAM manager and microcontroller subsystem operates as a dedicated ROS2 node, communicating over well-defined ROS topics and services.
Central CPU acts as the ROS master node, coordinating distributed tasks and real-time updates.
Diagnostics & Safety:
Battery levels, memory usage, and communication integrity are monitored and published via ROS topics for live diagnostics and emergency fallback.
Significance:
The Arc Reactor module is the foundational layer of the ROS-IM suit, enabling all future modules to interface efficiently with centralized power, computation, and connectivity. 
Its modular architecture supports robust upgrades, distributed intelligence, and advanced safety protocols essential for wearable robotics.
